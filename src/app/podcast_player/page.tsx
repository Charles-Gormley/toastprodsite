// Architectural Pattern for the Podcast Player.
// 1. Podcast Recommendation (This is already done)
// 2. Intro Retrieval.
// 3. Podcast Preview Retrieval (Segment 1 & Segment 2)
// Display the podcast preview in the text on the page.
// Display the podcast preview title on the right side vertically, these buttons should just start to appear.

// 4. When intro is done grab the next segment. ( Develop this a linked list of segments.)
// 5. When the next segment is done grab the next segment.
